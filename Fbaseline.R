## Read Assessment Results file from CDF package into R

## Read Student Demographics file from CDF package into R

## Read Class Assignments file from CDF package into R

## Merge student info with teacher names
## To work properly, the Class Assignments file should contain exactly one row for each student, with one ELA teacher and one math teacher listed.
## Any students without teachers in the Class Assignments file will be included with teachers listed as "NA"
## But any students whose IDs are not in the Student Demographics file will be excluded (should not normally happen)

fstudentswithteachers <- merge(x=fstudents, y=fteachers, by="StudentID", all.x=TRUE)

## Merge student info with scores, joining on student ID
## Include any records in the score table that are not in the student info table (should not usually happen)
## but do not include records in the student info table not in the score table (students not tested)
